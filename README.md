# fortune teller
A silly fortune teller toy I did to practice HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript.

using media queries i tried to make the page responsive for small screens too as well as remove animation for ppl who prefer reduced motion in settings.

art is by myself.

color palette: [Summer Cream](https://lospec.com/palette-list/summer-cream) by [PIXELNACHO](https://lospec.com/pixelnacho).

TODO:
* get bg images working (!)
* add more fortunes :)
